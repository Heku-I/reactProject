Trying to learn React with a TODO-list project that implements a lot of the basics. 

The primary functions: 
We add new items to the list by writing the task to an input-field and pressing a button. 
Doing this the new task/item will pop up under on a list. 
On the already added list we have the option to check the task as completed or delete it completely. 


Next up: 
1. Adding a button that deletes everything. (Completed)
2. Adding a "Are you sure" step when deleting an item or when deleting everything. (Completed)
3. Adding a button that deletes completed tasks. (Completed)
